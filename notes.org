* Analysis
1. What are \(r\) and \(L\)
   - \(r\) is the hundreds of fish per month birth rate?
   - \(L\) is the maximum number of fish that can live in the pond, in hundreds of fish?
2. Graphing question: See ~analysis_q2.m~ for graph
   - Estimates:
     - L = 5.4, Y = 5, Rainbow
     - L = 8.1, Y = 7, Brown
     - L = 16.3 Y = 12, Brook
3. Graphing question: See ~analysis_q3.m~ for graph
   - Notes:
     - \(\displaystyle \lim_{y\to\infty} h(y) = p\)
     - \(\displaystyle \lim_{y\to 0} h(y) = 0\)
     - Yes this obviously makes physical sense, when there's no fish, there's no harvesting, and when there's loads of fish the harvesting is bounded by the rate people harvest.
4. Explor equil + stability (Eli)
   a. Equilibrium solution: a solution where (hmm, not sure how to describe, it can be stable/unstable)
   b. hmm
      1. graph?
      2. Newton's in python?
      3. Graph?
      4. graph?
* Numerical Solution
1. Graphing question: See ~numerical_q1.m~ for graph
2. Euler's pattern analysis
   1. I don't think my graph is right?
* Final Remarks/Report Conclusion
- Which species of trout best stock the lake
- Model weaknesses?
- How can model be improved?
- What effects should model account for?
- Etc?
* Need to finish draft
