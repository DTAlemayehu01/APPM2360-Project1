#+title: Notes

* Analysis
1. What are \(r\) and \(L\)
   - \(r\) is the hundreds of fish per month birth rate?
   - \(L\) is the maximum number of fish that can live in the pond, in hundreds of fish?
2. Graphing question, look to matlab/python, or should i graph myself?
   - Estimates:
     - L = 5.4, Y = 5, Rainbow
     - L = 8.1, Y = 7, Brown
     - L = 16.3 Y = 12, Brook
3. graph myself?
4. Explor equil + stability
   a. Equilibrium solution: a solution where (hmm, not sure how to describe, it can be stable/unstable)
   b. hmm
      1. graph?
      2. Newton's in python?
      3. Graph?
      4. graph?
* Numerical Solution
1. Code to implement Euler's
2. Euler's pattern analysis
* Final Remarks/Report Conclusion
- Which species of trout best stock the lake
- Model weaknesses?
- How can model be improved?
- What effects should model account for?
- Etc?
